### SAP Application Performance Standard or SAPS

SAPS is a unit of measurement that describes the performance (throughput result) of a SAP system configuration. This hardware-independent unit is based on the SAP Sales and Distribution (SD) Benchmark.

From the <a href="http://global.sap.com/campaigns/benchmark/measuring.epx" target="_blank">SAP website</a>

* SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) is a hardware-independent unit of measurement that describes the performance of a system configuration in the SAP environment. It is derived from the Sales and Distribution (SD) benchmark, where 100 SAPS is defined as 2,000 fully business processed order line items per hour.
* In technical terms, this throughput is achieved by processing 6,000 dialog steps (screen changes), 2,000 postings per hour in the SD Benchmark, or 2,400 SAP transactions.
* In the SD benchmark, fully business processed means the full business process of an order line item: creating the order, creating a delivery note for the order, displaying the order, changing the delivery, posting a goods issue, listing orders, and creating an invoice.

SAP's benchmarking procedure has been standardized and well defined. It is monitored by the SAP benchmark council made up of representatives of SAP and technology partners involved in benchmarking. Originally introduced to strengthen quality assurance, the SAP Standard Application Benchmarks can also be used to test and verify scalability, concurrency, power efficiency, and multi-user behavior of system software components, RDBMS, and business applications.
