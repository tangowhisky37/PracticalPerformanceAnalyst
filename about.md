## Melbourne RaspberryPi Hackers Group

Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers group generally meet once a month with the objective of sharing, collaborating on Open Hardware projects with a specific focus on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc. Our meetups are a great opportunity to get together and hack individually or as groups on Open Source / Open Hardware challenges. From time to time we at Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers conduct tutorials/workshops to get amateurs and newbies started with hacking with the Raspberry Pi and Arduinos.  

* Our meetups and workshops are open to anyone who has an interest in hacking open source and open hardware. Anyone who wants to be a digital maker with interests in open hardware e.g. Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, etc. is invited to bring along their kits/projects and come hack with us at the meetup. 
* Our meetups are an opportunity to meet with other like minded open hardware/open source hackers here in Melbourne, to get your questions answered, to show off the work you are doing and get going on those problems that have stalled progress on your hobby projects. 
* Digital makers and hackers of all ages, including kids and women with interests in open hardware, open source are welcome to the meetup. 
* We keep in touch through [Slack](https://melbrpi.slack.com) Slack is a web based platform that provides capability for individual and group chat with many other interesting features that foster collaboration among individuals.
