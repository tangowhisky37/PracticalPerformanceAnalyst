Practical Performance Analyst is the face of a movement that aims to bring about awareness on the basic common sense practices associated with Performance Engineering. Practical Performance Analyst is the face of our revolution whose motto is to gather knowledge, share experiences and help other budding Performance Engineers gain the required skills to build applications that perform. At Practical Performance Analyst we need your support to manage the platform, sustain the momentum and give professionals around the world the opportunity to share, collaborate and create repositories of knowledge that can be used to train budding Performance Engineers across organizations globally. So here’s what will you find at the Practical Performance Analyst.

* Articles – Articles on your areas of interest, How-to’s, Tool Reviews and Case studies and experiences related to Performance Engineering across the Development Life Cycle. Includes articles on Performance Modelling, Performance Testing, Performance Monitoring, APM, Capacity Planning, Capacity Management, Performance Tuning and Application Diagnostics.
* iPEN – Educational content to help professionals and organizations build capability in Systems Performance Engineering
* SPE Fundamentals – SPE Fundamentals at Practical Performance Analyst covers the basic concepts of Systems Performance Engineering across the Software Development Life Cycle. Here you will find definitions of the various Systems Performance  Engineering activities including an introduction to some of the important concepts for each of those activities.
Authors Corner – Our authors are passionate about what they do, have loads of experiences and happen to be experts in different areas of SPE (Systems Performance Engineering) across the SDLC (Systems Development Life Cycle). At Authors Corner we list various contributions made by our authors which you might find useful in your quest for learning more about SPE (Systems Performance Engineering) across the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).
* SPE Advocacy – At this section you will find a list of resources to help you with advocacy of SPE (Systems Performance Engineering) and Proactive Performance Management (PPM) processes across the organization.
* Point Of View – Point of View will present current industry analysis on various different paradigms that are important to professionals with interests in Systems Performance Engineering. These are paradigms and concepts that are important to us professionals with interests in Systems Performance. Point Of View or PoV intends to provide an unbiased view of the various industry paradigms where we will ask ourselves the relevant questions and seek to understand the lay of the land from a Performance Architect / Performance Engineers standpoint
* SPE HowTo’s – SPE HowTos is an initiative that focuses on providing simple, easy to follow instructions on various common Systems Performance Engineering related activities across the SDLC. The SPE HowTos section is modeled after the famous open source Linux HowTos which we all grew up with over the last couple of decades.
* PE BoK – Support development of the Open Framework for Performance Engineering

We sincerely hope that with your support we will be able to continue our mission and invest in building the capability and open knowledgebase that can be made available to everyone out there.

It’s a long journey and as they say every long journey starts with a small step. So here we go. We strongly believe that working together as a community we can bring about change and impact people’s lives in a positive manner.
