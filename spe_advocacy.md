## Melbourne RaspberryPi Hackers Group

Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers group who's members meet once a month with the objective of sharing, collaborating on interesting Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc. related projects and hacking together on Open Source / Open Hardware platforms. From time to time  Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers conducts tutorials/workshops to get amateurs and newbies started with hacking with the Raspberry Pi and Arduinos.  

The meetup is open to anyone who has an interest in hacking open source and open hardware. Hackers (budding, amateurs, etc.) with interests in open hardware e.g. Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, etc. are invited to bring along their projects and come hack with us at the meetup. 

The meetup is an opportunity to meet with other  open hardware/open source hackers here in Melbourne, to get your questions answered, to show off the work you are doing and get going on those problems that have stalled progress on your hobby projects.
