Advocacy as you know is defined as, Public support for or recommendation of a particular cause or policy. But Advocacy here at Practical Performance Analyst goes beyond just creating public support. Advocacy at Practical Performance Analyst is an initiative whose focus is to assist you with building the case for Proactive Performance Management within your organization. SPE Advocacy intends to help you advocate the need for SPE (Systems Performance Engineering) practices across the Systems Development Life Cycle.

Here are the various objectives of Advocacy at Practical Performance Analyst.

  * Help you articulate the need for Proactive Performance Management across the Development Life Cycle
  * Help you articulate the benefits and importance of SPE (Systems Performance Engineering) practices across the Development Life Cycle
  * Help you articulate the various activities that need focus from a Proactive Performance Management perspective across the Development Life Cycle
  * Help you put together the relevant resources required to make a request for Proactive Performance Management across the Development Life Cycle

On this page you&#8217;ll find a list of resources to help you with advocacy of SPE (Systems Performance Engineering) and Proactive Performance Management (PPM) processes across the organization.
