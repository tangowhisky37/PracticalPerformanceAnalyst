## Melbourne RaspberryPi Hackers Group

The Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers Group is open to anyone who has an interest in hacking open source and open hardware. Digital makers and hackers with interests in open hardware e.g. Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, etc. are invited to bring along their projects and come hack with us at the meetup. This is an opportunity to meetup with other hackers here in Melbourne, to get your questions answered, to show off the work you are doing and get going on those problems that have stalled progress on your hobby projects. We welcome hackers of all ages, including women and kids with interests in open hardware, open source. 

The usual monthly Melbourne RaspberryPi Hackers Group meetup follows the format presented below -

* Duration & Schedule - We generally meet once every month on a saturday afternoon. This could be either the first or last saturday of the month. Please check the meetup page for details. The sessions start generally at 1300 Hrs AEST and finish by 1700 Hrs AEST. 
* Hands on Tutorials - Meetups are a great opportunity to collaborate and learn. At each of the upcoming meetups we will run a short tutorial lasting 20-30 minutes led by one of our hackers. This could be a short tutorial which would help you understand the software/hardware stack the RaspberryPi is based on in more detail or it could involve the use of sensors to interact with the world around you. In some of these tutorials you will have the opportunity to use your RaspberryPi, interface it with the real world using sensors, learn how to acquire the data so that you are able to make sense of the data and make decisions based on data acquired. Watch out for details of the tutorials.
* Group Hacking - The meetup aims to be one big Hacking Session. You can get hands on, form groups, get hacking and work together to solve problems!!!. Our meetups are a great opportunity to ask questions, learn and share what you have learned with the others at the meetup.
* Kids Can Hack Too - Kids are welcome. If you are bringing them along please drop us a note and let me know.
* Location - Our meetups are held at the Connected Community Hackerspace located at - `Connected Community Hacker Space, 5 Kent Lane, Hawthorn`.

To get the most out of the meetup we would recommend you bring along -

* Your laptop with an ethernet port and wifi connection
* CCHS offers wireless access but we would recommend that you bring along your Phone and 3G internet connection (if you want to connect to the internet) just in case.
* Raspberry Pi (if you have one) along with a wireless dongle (If you own a Raspberry Pi 2), or your Arduino, ESP8266, etc.
* A 2.5 A USB Power Adapter if you are using a Raspberry Pi (please be cautious, especially if using a Raspberry Pi 3). For those with ESP8266 boards (NodeMCU, Wemo, etc.) a 5v, 2A power supply with a micro USB port is recommended. For those with an Arduino a 5v, 2A regulated power supply with a USB Type B is required.
* Ethernet cable if you have one and need to troubleshoot any connectivity issues with the Rasberry Pi
* We have a couple of monitors which you can borrow for the session. There aren't many to go around so be open to timesharing them...:)
* Please bring along any Open Hardware or Raspberry Pi projects you have built. We are very keen for members to show and tell, sharing with the community the knowledge they have gained hacking their own projects.

We keep in touch through [Slack](https://melbrpi.slack.com) Slack is a web based platform that provides capability for individual and group chat with many other interesting features that foster collaboration among individuals. If you are keen to hang out and chat about the projects you are working on, get help on issues your facing or just want to hang out and help others with your supreme hacking skills please grab a slack account and join us by clicking on the following link - [Slack Registration](https://melbrpi.herokuapp.com).
