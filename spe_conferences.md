### ACM / SPEC ICPE (International Conference on Performance Engineering)

Extract from the ICPE Website, &#8220;The goal of the International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) is to integrate theory and practice in the field of performance engineering by providing a forum for sharing ideas and experiences between industry and academia. ICPE is established as a joint meeting of the ACM Workshop on Software and Performance (WOSP) and the SPEC International Performance Evaluation Workshop (SIPEW). The conference brings together researchers and industry practitioners to share and present their experiences, discuss challenges, and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software and systems, including performance measurement, modeling, benchmark design, and run-time performance management.

![ICPE]({{ "/assets/img/icpe.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Since its inception in 1998, WOSP has brought together software engineers, developers, performance analysts and software/performance modelers who are addressing the challenges of increasing system complexity, rapidly evolving software technologies, short time to market, incomplete documentation, and less-than-adequate methods, models and tools for developing, modeling, and measuring scalable, high-performance software. The focus of WOSP is therefore in the intersection of software and performance, rather than one discipline in isolation.

SIPEW was established by the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) with the goal to provide a forum for sharing ideas and experiences between industry and academia in the areas of computer benchmarking, performance evaluation, and experimental system analysis. The scope of the workshop includes methodologies, techniques and tools for measurement, load testing, profiling, workload characterization, dependability and efficiency evaluation of computing systems. While the focus is on performance and scalability, other extra-functional system properties such as availability, reliability, cost and energy efficiency are considered as well.&#8221;

### Large Scale Testing 

Many large-scale software systems (e.g., e-commerce websites, telecommunication infrastructure and enterprise systems, etc.) must service hundreds, thousands or even millions of concurrent requests. Many field problems of these systems are due to their inability to scale to field workloads, rather than feature bugs. In addition to conventional functional testing, these systems must be tested with large volumes of concurrent requests (called the _load_) to ensure the quality of these systems. _Large-scale testing_ includes all different objectives and strategies of testing large-scale software systems using load. Examples of large-scale testing are live upgrade testing, load testing, high availability testing, operational profile testing, performance testing, reliability testing, stability testing and stress testing.

![Large Scale Testing]({{ "/assets/img/large_scale_testing.png" | absolute_url }})

### RAPIDO 

The focus of the RAPIDO Workshop is on methods and tools for rapid simulation and performance evaluation in embedded and high performance systems design. Given continuous advances in chip technology, it is to be expected that future-generation processors will integrate numerous units on a single die, including multiple processor cores, multiple levels of (shared/private) caches or memories, and multiple dedicated accelerators, which will be glued together through a network on-chip (NoC).

![RAPIDO]({{ "/assets/img/rapido.png" | absolute_url }})

The design space is huge though:

  * How many cores do we need?
  * Should we have a homogeneous or a heterogeneous design?
  * When dynamic reconfiguration must be performed?
  * How many caches/memories do we need?
  * How to choose the instruction set(s) for these cores?
  * What are the best code optimizations for a given application?
  * How to combine the different metrics (e.g. energy, latency and throughput) into a global search space?

All these design questions lead to a huge design space that needs to be explored and which poses a grand challenge to search this space and to deliver an optimal design within the tight time-to-market budget.

WOPR's primary focus is on evaluating system performance and reliability. This includes performance measurement, load and stress testing, scalability testing, reliability measurement and evaluation, and system and product certification.

![WOPR]({{ "/assets/img/WOPR.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Important but secondary areas of interest include:

  * Performance and reliability engineering: system design, network design, database design, self-tuning systems, and self-healing systems.
  * System functional testing: test tools and automation frameworks, test planning, data visualization and analysis, test results evaluation, software fault injection, failure analysis, and test lab versus live field testing.
  * Operational management: capacity planning, disaster recovery planning, performance tuning, bottleneck identification, troubleshooting, debugging, service level agreements (SLAs) and quality of service (QoS), and managing vendor relationships.
  * Management: managing teams who work in the areas above.

The heart of each workshop session is a series of experiential presentations and group discussions, which focus on the chosen topic for the particular workshop. The atmosphere is collaborative, supportive and constructively critical.&#8221;
