The organizers here at the Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers Group are working on putting together detailed agenda including content for a series of workshops. The topics for the workshops are - 

* Raspberry Pi Fundamentals Workshop
* Raspberry Pi Workshop for Advanced Users

As the name suggests these workshops will cater to begginers and advanced users covering various aspects of the Raspberry Pi, the Linux Operating system it runs on, managing and maintaing the operating system on the Raspberry Pi, writing programs with the Raspberry Pi and most importantly interacting with the external world using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins combined with external sensors.

The workshops are being designed to deliver a great learning experience and will be delivered at the CCHS (Connected Community Hackerspace) premises. Keen to get your input and feedback through which hopefully the workshops will evolved and continue to deliver some value.

The design of the detailed agenda and the content is at an early stage. However all the content for the workshop will be listed here at the website free for everyone to access. So watch this space for details. 

Calling Volunteers - Those interested in helping out with design of the content or even delivering the workshop should get in touch with either of the organizers. Please see below for contact details of the organizers.
