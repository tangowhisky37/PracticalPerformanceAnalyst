It's time to roll out the old and roll in the new. So here we go!!!!!!!

If feels good to let you know that we have just moved away from our locally hosted wordpress website for Practical Performance Analyst to a high performance website hosted on Jekyll. 

The migration has overall taken a couple of months, stalling and then re-starting a few times. However are nearing the end of the migration with just a few sections yet to be migrated. Am expecting the remaining couple of sections to be done by the end of this year.  

The new website should be slick, simple to navigate, without any ads, with minimal graphics and super fast from a performance standpoint. 

What we haven't migrated though is all the articles at the older wordpress website. The plan is to have each of the the articles posted as blog posts at the new Jekyll website over the coming year.

So in summary, over the coming month I'll be working on migration of the remaining content to Jekyll. Only once the migration completes will i then focus on developing content for the areas where gaps exist across Practical Performance Analyst. 

Hope you find the content here at Practical Performance Analyst useful. Have fun and happy hacking.
