It's exciting times here at the Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers Group. Over the last few weeks we've been focused on putting together a website for the organization. The initiative was initially focused on communicating the agenda of the workshops being planned but then eventually grew into the communication platform for the meetup with content for the workshop being part of the platform.

It's early days but we have the initial website up and running. The website includes information that most members would find useful including information to help new comers get started with their hacking journey. For now we've added the following sections -

* About Us
* Details on the workshops to be conducted
* Links to vendors where you might want to pick up your Arduino or the Raspberry Pi
* Details on the format and structure of the monthly meetups
* Rules and regulations that govern the meetup and it's regular meetings

We hope you find the website useful. Keen to get your input and feedback through which hopefully the website will evolved and continue to deliver some value.
